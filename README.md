# Wavebreaker Installer
Installer for the Wavebreaker client made with Tauri.

# Usage
Download the .exe file from [the latest release](https://github.com/AudiosurfResearch/Wavebreaker-Installer/releases/latest) and run it, the rest is self-explanatory.

If it breaks, you're probably missing WebView2. [Download it from Microsoft.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703)
